# Classification-of-animal-sounds
Develop a neural network model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron to classify  animal sounds. The project will focus on distinguishing between dog and cat sounds using provided  datasets. The primary goal is to measure the accuracy of the developed model.
1. Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
 
3. Data Visualization: Implement effective data visualization techniques to gain insights from the datasets.

4. Data Processing: Preprocess the data to make it suitable for training the model.

5. Data Extraction: Extract relevant features from the audio data to feed into the neural network.

6. Data Augmentation: Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset.

7. Model Building: Construct a Multi-Layer Perceptron model and explore various techniques to improve accuracy.

8. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and generate a confusion matrix.
